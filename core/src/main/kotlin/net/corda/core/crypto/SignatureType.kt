 * Supported Signature types:

 * <li>FULL_MERKLE = signature covers whole transaction, by the convention that signing the Merkle root, it is equivalent to signing all parts of the transaction.
 * <li>PARTIAL = signature covers only a part of the transaction, see [MetaData].
 * <li>BLIND = when an entity blindly signs without having full knowledge on the content.
 * <li>PARTIAL_AND_BLIND = combined PARTIAL and BLIND in the same time.
